Hello! My name is Julia and in this video I’ll talk about myself, a little about my experience and why I decided to study programming.

I was born in Belarus. I studied at the Minsk Institute of Management at the Faculty of Finance and Credit, and after six long years of distance learning, I received a degree in economics.
After completing three courses of study, I got a job in a bank, and I continued to work in this area for the next ten years. 

My duties were to serve bank customers, arrange loans, deposits, plastic cards and everything else in this area. 
A clean spacious office, a friendly young team, a decent salary - I had all of this, but ...
About a year ago, my family and I received an offer to move to Poland. Without hesitation, we dropped everything and a month later we were already here. 

Moving to another country contributed to the search a new profession. The idea to get into programming came to me, looking at my friend, who, having moved from another country to Poland, works in this field remotely and receives a decent salary. Then I stumbled upon the RS School java script developer courses. 
In December last year, I started learning at the zero stage absolutely from scratch, not understanding even the elementary things like how to set up VS Code to work in it, but the difficulties gave me more strength and perseverance to continue learning. Then the first stage of training began and we were creating a new project Shelter. It was necessary to create a two-page site based on a figma layout. 
Thanks to the administration of the course for the fact that such a stylish and beautiful layout with cute pets is now in my portfolio. Unfortunately, I didn’t manage to do everything qualitatively. For example, for the first page, it was necessary to implement a slider in such a way that the cards wouldn’t be repeated when turning over. Sadly, the cards are repeated in my slider. But I managed to make a popup for cards with pets, a burger menu on both pages with a darkened back screen, a slider for the second page showing the current page number. Thanks to this project, I got a good experience with java script and a little understanding of this language.

Now, being at the end of the first stage of training, I can say with confidence that I like programming, that I’ll definitely not give up this difficult path and I’ll try to do my best to get the first developer job offer.

Thank you for watching!
